# ClearSkies
The project ClearSkies, focuses on forecasting AQI to provide valuable insights into air quality dynamics and can inform future air quality management strategies. The core idea is to use historical and real-time air quality data to predict AQI values. Identify the pollutants that most significantly impact the AQI and generate daily reports with forecasts and summaries of pollutant contributions.
